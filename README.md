__Authors: Cheng ZHANG & Shiwen XIA__

We implemented the SNVRG algorithm proposed by DONGruo ZHOU et al. in this [paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7648-stochastic-nested-variance-reduced-gradient-descent-for-nonconvex-optimization.pdf) and the SCSG algorithm proposed by Lihua LEI et al. in this [paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6829-non-convex-finite-sum-optimization-via-scsg-methods.pdf). All scripts and experiments are in the notebook `demo.ipynb`.
